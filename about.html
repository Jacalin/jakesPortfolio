I first discovered programming while in college studying Cogntive Science. It didn't take long for me to realize that coding was something I really enjoyed, and decided not long after my first introductory computer science course that coding was the profession that I would pursue. </p> <p> Soon there after, I applied for, and became a member of the High Level Perception Labortory at UC Santa Cruz. While working as a research assistant, I coded an experiment using the python programming language. Since then, I have focused primarly on web development, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p> <p> I hope to be employed as a Full Stack Web Developer one day, potentially fusing my love for the brain with my passion for web design. I'm currently looking for an entry level developer role, where I can utilize my skills and grow into a great programmer. </p> </div> </div> <footer> </footer> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="/jakesPortfolio/about.bundle.js"></script></body> </html>
